# Keycloak

Keycloak is an open-source identity and access management tool that provides robust solutions for securing applications and services. This document highlights key features and terms that are crucial for understanding and working with Keycloak.

## Key Features

### Single Sign-On (SSO) and Single Logout
- **Single Sign-On (SSO):** Allows users to authenticate once and gain access to multiple applications without needing to log in again. SSO enhances user experience by streamlining the authentication process across different systems.
- **Single Logout:** When a user logs out of one application, they are automatically logged out of all applications connected through Keycloak, ensuring a consistent and secure logout process.

### Identity Brokering and Social Login
- **Identity Brokering:** Keycloak can act as an intermediary between your applications and external identity providers (IdPs) like Google, Facebook, or any other OpenID Connect or SAML 2.0 provider.
- **Social Login:** Users can authenticate using their existing credentials from social media accounts. Keycloak supports a wide range of social identity providers, simplifying the login process and reducing the need for password management.

### User Federation
- **User Federation:** Keycloak can integrate with existing external user databases or directories like LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) or Active Directory. This allows organizations to leverage Keycloak without duplicating user data.

### Fine-Grained Authorization Services
- **Fine-Grained Authorization:** Keycloak provides detailed control over user permissions and access to resources. Complex policies and rules can be defined to dictate who can access specific resources or perform certain actions within an application.

### Centralized Management and Admin Console
- **Admin Console:** Keycloak offers a web-based admin console that allows administrators to manage users, roles, groups, and clients across multiple applications from a single interface. This centralized management simplifies identity and access control across an organization.

### Client Adapters
- **Client Adapters:** Keycloak provides client adapters for different platforms and programming languages, such as Java, JavaScript, and Node.js. These adapters simplify the integration of applications with Keycloak by handling the complexity of protocols like OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect.

### Standards-Based
- **Standards Support:** Keycloak supports industry-standard protocols such as OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, and SAML 2.0, ensuring secure and consistent integration with your applications and compatibility with other identity management solutions.

## Key Terms

### Realm
A realm in Keycloak is a space where you manage a set of users, credentials, roles, and groups. Realms allow you to isolate and manage different environments or applications independently. For example, you could have a realm for your production environment and a separate one for development.

### Client
A client is an application that wants to authenticate users. In Keycloak, clients are entities that Keycloak protects, such as web applications, mobile apps, or APIs. When you configure a client in Keycloak, you define how this application interacts with Keycloak, including redirect URIs, protocols, and authentication settings.

### Client Scope
Client scopes are used to define a set of protocol mappers and role scope mappings that are shared between multiple clients. They help to group roles or protocol mappers that clients can use, making it easier to manage permissions and claims that are sent to clients.

### Users
Users in Keycloak are the individuals who have accounts within a realm. Users can be assigned roles, be part of groups, and have specific attributes associated with their account. Keycloak manages user credentials, such as passwords or tokens.

### Groups
Groups are a way to organize users in Keycloak. By creating groups, you can assign roles and attributes to a group, and all users in that group inherit those roles and attributes. This is useful for managing permissions for a large number of users at once.
